# Week4_go_assignment

For this, I installed GO on my computer before I started.
I used Git to clone the repository from https://github.com/suraiya-jabeen/Week4_go_assignment.git.
Then I launched the Visual Studio code terminal, and then I used the cd command to move to the directory folder.
I run the go-run main. go command to proceed.

what is needed!

In case you haven't done so, install Go on your computer.
A new directory called Week4_go_assignment should be created.
Launch Command Prompt and use cd to get to the Week4_go_assignment folder.
Use the command go mod init https://github.com/suraiya-jabeen/Week4_go_assignment/go to initialize a Go module.
Create a Go file called "main.go" that has the welcome you want.
Run the go-run main.go Command to see how your greeting is received.
